# Trucker
This is a side project that I've had in my mind for a while. It's main objective is to provide a marketplace for food trucks where they can sell their products online and where customers can obtain information on when and where they can find a specific food truck.

Whether there is an actual need in the market for this product or not is still unclear, the main purpose of developing this project is to improve my React and Express skills while also learning more about REST APIs and the usage of GraphQL.

## Objectives
- Learn about OAuth
- Usage of Database First techniques for the ORM
- Improving my React+Redux knowledge
- Improving HTML and CSS knowledge
- Improving my Express.js knowledge
- Hosting it over Digital Ocean
- Learning about GraphQL
- Getting more comfortable with TypeScript

## Functionalities
This section will be divided in those implemented and those pending implementation. It is based on these main functionalities that I will design the rest API and the React application.

### To be implemented

For a normal user:
- Visualize food trucks near a certain location
- Visualize the details of a specific food truck (these details are pending to be defined)
- Ordering food from a foodtruck
- Visualizing the projected route of a food truck (to be further specified)
- Creating an account. OAuth must be available.

For a food truck owner:

- Food truck creation
- Menu creation
- Schedule definition
- Real-time update of the location
- Menu availability updates.
